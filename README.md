# CHIP-8 emulator for learning purposes

Code archive from 2021

This code was written by me a long time ago and is incomplete.
Maybe someday I'll try to refactor it and finish it.
For the meantime, you can use it for learning about the CHIP-8 Virtual Machine.

The binaries in `roms/` are not mine and the LICENSE does not apply to them.
